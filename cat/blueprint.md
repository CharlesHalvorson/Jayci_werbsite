# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple website that displays random cat pictures. The user can click a button to load a new cat picture. The goal is to create a visually appealing and responsive website that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Details

### Style and Design
*   **Layout:** A simple, single-column layout with the cat picture as the main focus.
*   **Color Palette:** A dark blue background with white text and a light-colored button.
*   **Typography:** A clean, readable font for the heading.
*   **Visuals:** The main visual is a randomly loaded image of a cat. The image has a decorative border.

### Features
*   **Random Cat Pictures:** The website displays a new cat picture from `cataas.com` on each page load.
*   **"New Cat Picture" Button:** A button that reloads the page to show a new cat picture.

## Current Task: Responsive Design for Mobile

### Plan
1.  **Add Media Queries:** Add CSS media queries to `style.css` to adjust the layout and styling for mobile devices, specifically iPhones.
2.  **Responsive Image:** Make the cat picture scale correctly on smaller screens.
3.  **Adjust Typography:** Reduce the font size of the heading on mobile to improve readability.
